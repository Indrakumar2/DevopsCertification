AWS cloud History:

Lauched in2002 internally in amazon.com 

Then amazon launched its first aws service publically SQS in 2004

In 2006 they expanded their services publically with SQS, S3 and EC2

2007 they launched in Europe.

and they expanded their services all over globe and became the leader in cloud Providers.

In 2019 it generated over 35billion annual revenue, accounting 47% of the market in 2019

AWS Use Cases:

It enabels to build spophiscated, scalable application.

They are applicable to diverse set if industries.

It includes, enterpriseIT, Backup & storage, Big Data analytics.

Webhosting, creating backend for Mobile & SocialApps

We can run entire gamnig servers running in cloud.

AWS Global Infrastructure:

It has: AWS Regions, AWS Availability zones, AWS Data Centers, AWS Edge Locations/ Points of Presence.

AWS Regions: 

AWS has Regions all around the world.

Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3...

A Region is a cluster of datacenters

Most AWS services are region based, so when we are using a service it will be linked and scoped in specific region,
that means when we are using a service in one region and we try it use it another region, it will like new time of using that service.

How to Choose an AWS Region?

If you need to launch a new application where should you do it?

Factors need to be considered while choosing a region:

Compliance with data goverance and legal requirements: Data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.

Proximity to customers: reduced latency.(user numbers)

Availabily of services with a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every region need to make sure before deploying the application.

Pricing: Pricing Varies region to region and is transperent in the service pricing stage.

AWS Availablity Zones

It will be inside a Region

Each Region has many availability zones(min3, max6)

For example, in sydney there are three availability zones, each availability zones is one or more discrete data centers with 
redundant power, networking and connectivity.

They are separate from each other, so that they are isolated from diasters, suppose if something happens to one of the AZ 
we know that is designed not to cascade to other AZs

They are connected with high bandwidh, ultra-low latency networking and all linked together forms a AWS region.

AWS Points of Presence(Edge Locations):

Amazon has 400+ points of presence(400+ edge locations & 10+ Regional caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.

With this it can deliver the contents to the end users with lower latency as possible.

AWS Global services: 

IAM
Route 53 (DNS services)
CloudFront(Content Delivery Network)
WAF(Web application Firewall)

Most AWS Services are Region Scoped:

EC2
Elastic Beanstalk(Platform as a Service)
Lambda(function as service)
Rekongnition(software as service)
